# About

An in progress website that has scraped data from [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) archives. This project was started when Google did not have a proper filtering system to look at the organizations that were participating and their details. This is inspired from [GSoC Analyzer](https://github.com/Sparsh1212/gsocanalyzer).

This project was a way to learn the REACT framework and how to webscrape using Selenium. So far, I have created the scraping scripts and due to ongoing work have been unable to work on learning creating the website that leverages this data.

I have created an [API](https://github.com/tashi21/gsoc-api) using Go that uses the scraped data.
