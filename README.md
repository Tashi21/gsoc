# About

A scraper tat gets data from [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) archives. This project was started when Google did not have a proper filtering system to look at the organizations that were participating and their details. This is inspired from [GSoC Analyzer](https://github.com/Sparsh1212/gsocanalyzer).

This project was a way to learn how to webscrape using Selenium.

I have created an [API](https://github.com/tashi21/gsoc-api) using Go that uses the scraped data.
